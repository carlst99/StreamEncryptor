# StreamEncryptor
StreamEncryptor aims to make the encryption and authentication of streams as easy as possible.

Please note that I am no expert in encryption! Hence, there may be issues that I am not aware of.

### Installation
You can download StreamEncryptor from [nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/StreamEncryptor/)

### Documentation
See [Getting Started](https://github.com/carlst99/StreamEncryptor/wiki/Getting-Started) in the wiki for the basics. I am slowly building up more advanced and complete documentation.
