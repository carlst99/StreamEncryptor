# StreamEncryptor
A small helper library to encrypt, decrypt and authenticate streams. This is currently a work in progress, but it is in a working state.
Please note that I am no expert in encryption, and this is simply a helpful wrapper that I created. Hence, there may be issues
that I am not aware of!

### Installation
You can download StreamEncryptor from [nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/StreamEncryptor/)

### Documentation
The library itself is (I think) pretty self-explanatory, however I will be adding documentation in the wiki when I get round to it
